1)  Introduction about Bluetooth automation

Smartphones are the new craze and they have made life easier than ever. They are portable and always in the pockets. This portability of smartphones have led the marketers and the designers to develop services and solutions around the mobile domain. There are apps to shop online, do banking, trade stocks and uncountable day to day tasks. Then how can home automation systems remain isolated from the mobile technology.
a home automation system is designed which can be controlled by any smartphone. The automation system connects with the smartphone through Bluetooth. The smart phone sends control signals to switch home appliances ON or OFF by an android app through Bluetooth interface. 


2) 8051 Microcontroller

he 8051 Microcontroller was designed in the 1980s by Intel. Its foundation was on Harvard Architecture and was developed principally for bringing into play Embedded Systems.  The microcontroller is one kind of integrated circuit that includes 40-pins with dual inline package or DIP, RAM-128 bytes, ROM-4kb & 16-bit timers–2. Based on the requirement, it includes addressable & programmable 4 – parallel 8-bit ports. In the 8051 microcontroller architecture, the system bus plays a key role to connect all the devices to the central processing unit. This bus includes a data bus- an 8-bit, an address bus-16-bit & bus control signals. Other devices can also be interfaced throughout the system bus like ports, memory, interrupt control, serial interface, the CPU, timers.


3) Relays  

Relays are normally used in the control panels, manufacturing and building automation to control the power along with switching the smaller current values in a control circuit. However, the supply of amplifying effect can help control the large amperes and voltages because if low voltage is applied to the relay coil, a large voltage can be switched by the contacts.

If preventive relays are being used, it can detect overcurrent, overload, undercurrent, and reverse current to ensure the protection of electronic equipment. Last but not the least; it is used to heat the elements, switch on audible alarms, switch the starting coils, and pilots the lights.
