WHAT IS A SMARTWATCH ?

A smartwatch is a wearable computer in the form of a watch; modern smartwatches provide a local touchscreen interface for daily use, while an associated smartphone app. While early models could perform basic tasks, such as calculations, digital time telling, translations, and game-playing, 2010s smartwatches have more general functionality closer to smartphones, including mobile apps, a mobile operating system and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function as portable media players, with FM radio and playback of digital audio and video files via a Bluetooth headset. Some models, called watch phones (or vice versa), have mobile cellular functionality like making calls.

COMPONENTS USED ?

1) MICROCONTROLLER  :-

A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller includes a processor, memory and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.

2) LCD :-

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.

3)  VOLTAGE REGULATOR:-

A voltage regulator is a circuit that creates and maintains a fixed output voltage, irrespective of changes to the input voltage or load conditions. Voltage regulators (VRs) keep the voltages from a power supply within a range that is compatible with the other electrical components.

4)  MEMORY CHIP:-

A memory chip is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process code. Memory chips can hold memory either temporarily through random access memory (RAM), or permanently through read only memory (ROM). Read only memory contains permanently stored data that a processor can read but cannot modify. Memory chips comes in different sizes and shapes. Some can be connected directly while some need special drives. Memory chips are essential components in computer and electronic devices in which memory storage plays a key role.


5) BLUETOOTH:-

Bluetooth is a wireless technology that uses a radio frequency to share data over a short distance, eliminating the need for wires. You can use Bluetooth on your mobile device to share documents or to connect with other Bluetooth-enabled devices. For security reasons, Bluetooth devices must be paired before they can begin transferring information. The process of pairing your devices will vary depending on the device you are connecting to.


6) STEP COUTER SENSOR:-

A pedometer, or step-counter, is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips. Because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies. Distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a GPS receiver.


7) BLOOD PRESSURE SENSOR:-

The Blood Pressure Sensor is a non-invasive sensor designed to measure human blood pressure. It measures systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure utilizing the oscillometric method. Pulse rate is also reported.

8) ACCELROMETER:-

An accelerometer sensor is a tool that measures the acceleration of any body or object in its instantaneous rest frame. It is not a coordinate acceleration. Accelerometer sensors are used in many ways, such as in many electronic devices, smartphones, and wearable devices, etc. Accelerometers are used in biomedical applications, and biomedical field accelerometer sensors are mainly operated in step counting, activity monitoring, or motion artwork and suppression.


9) HEART BEAT:-

The heartbeat sensor is based on the principle of photoplethysmography. It measures the change in volume of blood through any organ of the body which causes a change in the light intensity through that organ (avascular region). In the case of applications where the heart pulse rate is to be monitored, the timing of the pulses is more important. The flow of blood volume is decided by the rate of heart pulses and since light is absorbed by the blood, the signal pulses are equivalent to the heartbeat pulses.
