# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1) HLR1

   Door sensors

2) HLR2

    Count on Lcd 

3) HLR3

    Emission of LED


# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1.1) LLR1

      Push buttons act as a door sensors.
      
2.1)  LLR2

       count++ using sensor/door 1
       count-- using sensor/door 2

3.1)  LLR3

       count++ led emmit



# SWOT ANALYSIS


# STRENGTH

* Very precise
* Led will be ON whenever a person enetrs
* Count will be displayed on lcd 
* LED will automatically ON/OFF on enter and leaving

# WEAKNESS

* Light intensity will be same 
* If there are multiple doors for the same room the project becomes quite complex
* If there is only one door then it will very difficult for count
* IR sensor cannot detect if lots of people are entering at one time


# OPPORTUNITIS

* We can check the ambient light intensity and then decide if the light needs to be turned ON or not.
* Metal detector can be added for security reasons.

# THREATS

* Couldnt detect if lots of people are entering at one time.
* LED will turn ON whether needed or not
