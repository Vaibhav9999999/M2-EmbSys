# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1) HLR1          Door sensors

2) HLR2          Count on Lcd 

3) HLR3          Emission of LED

4) HLR4          Temprature sensor

5) HLR5          Buzzer


# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1.1) LLR1        Push buttons act as a door sensors.
      
2.1)  LLR2       count++ using sensor/door 1
                 count-- using sensor/door 2

3.1)  LLR3       count++ led emmit / Relays

4.1)  LLR4       Analog sensor

4.2)  LLR5       analog sensor with buzzer connection / Relays



# SWOT ANALYSIS


# STRENGTH

* Very precise
* Led will be ON whenever a person enetrs
* Count will be displayed on lcd 
* LED will automatically ON/OFF on enter and leaving
* Buzzer will notify about fire.

# WEAKNESS

* Light intensity will be same 
* If there are multiple doors for the same room the project becomes quite complex
* If there is only one door then it will very difficult for count
* IR sensor cannot detect if lots of people are entering at one time


# OPPORTUNITIS

* We can check the ambient light intensity and then decide if the light needs to be turned ON or not.
* Metal detector can be added for security reasons.
* Special arrangements for fire defense can be made.

# THREATS

* Couldnt detect if lots of people are entering at one time.
* LED will turn ON whether needed or not 

# 4W and 1H

1) Why ?

* Nedded to check no of person enetring and exiting

* Industries, buildings, homes

4) When ?

* Whenever a person enter
* In meetings

5) How ?
