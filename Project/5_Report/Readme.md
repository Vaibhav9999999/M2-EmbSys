# BIDIRECTIONAL VISITOR COUNTER


# Abstract 

Many times we need to monitor the person/people visiting some place like Seminar hall, conference room or Shopping mall or temple. This project can be used to count and display the number of visitors entering inside any conference room or seminar hall. This is a bidirectional counter which means it works in a two way. That means counter will be incremented if person enters the room and will be decremented if a person leaves the room. LCD displays this value which is placed outside the room.

This system is helpful for counting the number of people in an auditorium or halls for seminar to avoid congestion. Moreover it can also be used to check the number of people who have come to an event or a museum to watch a certain exhibit. Microcontroller is a reliable circuit that takes over the task of counting the number of persons/ visitors in the room very accurately. We will be showing bothe In count i.e. number of people entering the room and Out count i.e. number of people exiting the room on a 16x2 Alphanumeric LCD. An IR sensor is used to monitor the person entering and exiting the room.

The microcontroller does the above job. It receives the signals from the sensors, and this signal is operated under the control of software which is stored in ROM. Microcontroller 89s52 continuously monitor the Infrared Receivers. When any object pass through the IR Receiver's then the IR Rays falling on the receiver are obstructed, this obstruction is sensed by the Microcontroller.


#  Components

1) Switches 

an electronic switch is an electronic component or device that can switch an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another. Electronic switches are considered binary devices because they can be on or off. When an electronic switch is on, it is considered closed in a circuit. When the switch is classified as off, the switch is open in the circuit.

Typically, electronic switches use solid state devices such as transistors, though vacuum tubes can be used as well in high voltage applications. Electronic switches also consist of complex configurations that are assisted by physical contact. Physical contact typically comes from pressing or flipping a switch with your hand, but other forms of contact like light sensors and magnetic field sensors are used to operate switches.

Here we are using switches as a door sensor.


2)  Micro controller

 microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller includes a processor, memory and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.

Sometimes referred to as an embedded controller or microcontroller unit (MCU), microcontrollers are found in vehicles, robots, office machines, medical devices, mobile radio transceivers, vending machines and home appliances, among other devices. They are essentially simple miniature personal computers (PCs) designed to control small features of a larger component, without a complex front-end operating system (OS).


3) Power supply

A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power.


4) Relays

A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.

Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. Relays were first used in long-distance telegraph circuits as signal repeaters: they refresh the signal coming in from one circuit by transmitting it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

4.1) LED 

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor.[5] White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

4.2) LCD 

A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly,[1] instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.
